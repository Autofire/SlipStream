Abouth the _Tools folder:

This folder is for editor tools that have to do with the Variable Object system. These are here to make your life
as a developer easier when you inevitably create your own classes and want to make them work with the Variable Object
system.

In theory, you should be able to delete this entire folder, and the rest of the system would function just fine. You
would lose most of the Unity Editor functionality, though custom editors would still work fine.
